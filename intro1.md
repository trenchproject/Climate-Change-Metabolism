According to numerous models from various climate scientists, the earth is highly likely to continue warming for the remainder of the 21st century and beyond. Various models and projections summarized by David Herring at [Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature-projections) indicate that global temperature means will increase by between 2 and 9.7&deg;F in this century. The wide variability in this increase is based on the hypothetical differing climate emission regulation scenarios that may be implemented. For example, the 9.7&deg;F increase is likely if human carbon emissions continue to increase, a byproduct of continuing demand for coal, oil, and natural gas. The 2&deg;F increase represents a scenario in which humans make calculated, sustainable changes to traditional energy production and consumption standards.  

While the link between human emissions and a changing global climate are well documented and understood, the effect of these rising climatological means on the performance, behavior, and range of the animal kingdom are not often recognized. Over the past several decades, ecologists have gained a more complete understanding of fundamental connections between thermodynamics and how organisms perform in their natural environment. Thermal ecology is a field of ecology dedicated to understanding the complex interaction between organisms and their environment from a thermodynamics perspective. Essentially, every species in the animal kingdom has some range of temperatures in which it can survive as well as a more narrow range of temperatures in which it will perform optimally. Consider outdoor activities. A soccer player scrimmaging on a 104&deg;F summer day is likely to require more hydration, respire harder, and tire more quickly than the same player scrimmaging in 72&deg;F weather. This is because the human body is having to expend additional energy to regulate internal temperatures and prevent overheating. According to Professor Raymond Huey, a University of Washington biology professor, "Metabolic changes are key to understanding some major impacts of climate warming because a higher metabolic rate requires more food and more oxygen" ([Science Direct Press Release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101006141548.htm)). 

Additionally, thermoconforming ectotherms such as many fish and insect species are unable to efficiently self-regulate their internal body temperatures meaning their internal temperature remains similar to that of their surroundings. While climate change will undoubtedly affect every animal species to some degree, thermoconformers face an especially uncertain future as temperatures are poised to increase consistently past historical records. 

For a thermal ecologist, metabolism acts as an important proxy for overall organismal performance. "If, for example, an organism has to spend more time eating or conserving energy, it might have less time and energy for reproduction" ([Science Direct Press Release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101006141548.htm)). Understanding where and to what degree our natural world is being affected by the changing climate allows for smart regulation and protection efforts to have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable species. While the greatest changes in global temperature means are expected to occur at the poles, a [2010 publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09407?page=6) from Michael Dillon, George Wang, and Raymond Huey suggests that the impact of this change on individual species' metabolisms may be the most severe closer to the equator in the tropics and subtropics. This visualization aims to explore and visualize these findings interactively. As a preliminary step, weather stations were selected to represent a wide range of latitudes across multiple climate zones. These weather stations were dictated by data availability from the beginning of the traditional reference period for climate studies (1961) until the current year (2020).
