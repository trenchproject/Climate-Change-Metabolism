Thermoconforming and exposed ectotherms' body temperatures closely resemble that of their environment, so historical and current air temperature records can be utilized as a proxy for organismal body temperature in the visualization of metabolic trends over time. Daily weather data was sourced from each of the chosen stations, which are part of the [Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description), using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [online data portal](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search). This weather data was used as an input for the metabolic rate function, as presented in [Dillon et al. 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09407?page=6):
